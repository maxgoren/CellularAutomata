### A word on quality
```
WARNING: This is NOT high quality java code.
This code completely igores at least half of
the principles of object oriented programming.
getters and setters? Hah. Everything is declared 
public. Objects change the internal state of other 
objects on a whim all over the damn place. 
You've been warned.
